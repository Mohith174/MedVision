## 🔍 What the tool does  
Our **AI Medical Imaging Assistant** helps radiologists by:  
- Detecting wrist fractures with high accuracy  
- Automatically generating structured medical reports  
- Providing an intuitive analytics dashboard with customizable configurations  

### Under the hood  
- **Model:** Fine-tuned *DenseNet121* trained with the *MONAI library*  
- **Performance:** 80% accuracy on test data for wrist fracture detection  
- **Pipeline:** Batch inference engine updating a secure database  
- **Interface:** *Streamlit* UI for configuration, reporting, and analytics  
- **Reports:** Auto-generated using extracted *DICOM* features + AI predictions

## 🌍 The pillars of our project  

**Innovation:** Built on *REST APIs* and open-source frameworks, making it compatible with radiology systems like PACS. This enables seamless AI integration and prioritization of high-risk patients.  

**Impact:** Faster diagnosis, reduced radiology backlogs, and potential for remote healthcare delivery—crucial during pandemics or in underserved areas.  

**Implementation:** Python, MONAI, DenseNet121, FastAPI, Streamlit, and fpdf power the pipeline and interface, ensuring reliability and accessibility.  

**Feasibility:** Entirely based on open-source technologies, designed for real-world hospital integration.  

**Extendibility:** Adaptable to other imaging modalities—CT, MRI, Ultrasound, and X-rays—while supporting on-premises and private-cloud deployments for maximum privacy.
